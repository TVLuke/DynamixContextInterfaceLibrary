#Dynamix Context Interfaces

This is a collection of interfaces that is supposed to be used to create a consesus on how to model context data types. 

This is in its VERY early stages and has absolutely no claim to being complete yet.

Several of my DynamixPlugins are using the library:

* PingPlugin
* SensordronePlugin
